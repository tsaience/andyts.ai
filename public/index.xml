      <description>Having spent the last five years at MIT pursuing undergrad &amp;amp; masters degrees in cs, I want to write a handbook that I wish I had as a freshman.
Disclaimer: This is mostly about pure cs at MIT (course 6-3); MIT has a eecs major (course 6-2), but since that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my major, only parts that overlap with 6-3 are addressed. While I try to be objective, these are, at its core, opinions.</description>
